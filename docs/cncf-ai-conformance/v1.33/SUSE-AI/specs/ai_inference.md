# Networking: AI Inference

## Requirement

MUST: Support the Kubernetes Gateway API with an implementation for advanced traffic management for inference services, which enables capabilities like weighted traffic splitting, header-based routing (for OpenAI protocol headers), and optional integration with service meshes.

## Setup Configuration

- Setup an end to end SUSE AI instance on AWS using the automated setup at [https://github.com/suse/suse-ai-stack](https://github.com/suse/suse-ai-stack) 
- Note: the setup requires SUSE AI subcription for the SUSE OS registration, SUSE Application Collection and the SUSE Observability access.
